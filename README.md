Python scripts to create pathing between all daily treasures in Read Dead Redemption 2 online.

This script was created to optimize my personal play time and create the fastest path between all points.

After running the opt_test.py, a map image will be created that can be followed.

I had built up enough time in RDR2 where I didn't need any further map markers to use this.
